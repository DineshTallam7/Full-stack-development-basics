   <center><h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1></center>
   <h2><u>Introduction</h2></u><p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility further explanation needed provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting</p>

   <p>    1994- HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS.
    1996- The first version of CSS was invented.
    1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, fot instead of being a single monolithic specification, it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules. Each module dealt with a relatively small subset of the overall specification, and either added new features or refined and extended existing features. All additions and enhancements to the specification were written in order to be backward-compatible with older versions of CSS.
    2011- CSS 2.1 was released, which fixed the errors found in CSS 2.	CSS 3 is being developed as multiple separate modules. Regular snapshots summarize their status.
